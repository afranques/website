I‚Äôm Pedro Pi√±era Buend√≠a, multidisciplinary iOS Engineer. I studied Telecommunication Engineer I became interested in mobile development back in 2010, and I‚Äôve been doing that since then. I‚Äôve worked for companies like [Redbooth](https://redbooth.com), [8fit](https://8fit.com) and recently [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com). I‚Äôm a passionate runner and traveller.  I‚Äôm always willing to learn new things and become a better developer and person. I like sharing what I learn, and I do it on this website. I‚Äôm a strong believer in the power of openness. I‚Äôm open in many aspects of my life such as sharing the problems that I‚Äôm facing in life, my new discoveries as a developer, or the projects I work on that can be useful for more developers. Most of my spare time projects are open source libraries that I share on my GitHub account. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/pepibumur).

## Work experience

### [Redbooth](https://redbooth.com/)
##### From mid 2013 to October 2014
![icon](http://cdn0.capterra-static.com/logos/150/2078242.png)<br><br>
I started with Redbooth in 2013 and I joined the iOS team to work remotely as a freelance *(I was finishing my bachelor by that time)*. During the that year I was working for Redbooth I improved my knowledge on areas like data persistance, API interactions, Core Data, mobile architectures, Objective-C patterns, and had the opportunity to deal with XMPP helping the company to build its own chat client. Moreover I had the opportunity to work with the Android team, which for me was a good chance to dive into the Android basics.

### [8fit](http://8fit.com/)
##### From October 2014 to October 2015
![icon](http://static.elle.exp.mx/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/09090410/8fit-icon.png)<br><br>
At the end 2014 I left Redbooth to join 8fit, founded by Pablo Villalba, also founder of Redbooth. He had started a new project, and I got so motivated with it that I couldn't say no. On that new job position I took the role of Mobile Lead managing both, iOS and Android projects and supporting the web-app solution to offer the best mobile experience as possible. I worked on areas like In-App-Purchase payments, Android Expansion Packs, Mobile-Web patterns, Healthkit and GoogleFit integrations, and I learnt Javascript and some other web technologies.

### [GitDo](http://gitdo.io)
**From March 2015 until mid 2016**<br><br>
GitDo was my spare-time project between 2015 and 2016. I started with a college I worked with before at Redbooth. This project taught me about team management, product design, the importance of company values... I was founder of the project and I was forced to get my head out of the code editor. Sadly, we had to stop developing this project around mid 2016. The app was removed from the store and the website and social accounts were closed down.

### [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
##### From October 2015
![icon](http://www.scientificsaudi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Soundcloud-icon-150x150.png)<br><br>
I joined SoundCloud in October 2015 as iOS developer. During the time I've been working for SoundCloud, I've learnt about the use of Reactive programming in an very consolidated codebase and improved my architectural knowledge with new patterns I had never used before. In October 2016 I moved to a new team inside SoundCloud, **Core Clients**, providing other teams with tools and components to make them more productive.
