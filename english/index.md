Despite the fact that I have to use English every day in my company I feel that my pace learning English is very low. I'm not really investing time learning the language and my capacity retaining vocabulary is very low. I read expressions I memorize them but I'm very forgetful and I'll probably end up forgetting them and not using tme in contexts were would be great its use.

I also noticed that I tend to think in Spanish and translate to English which is not a good idea because it makes sentences construction complicated. Most of English expression don't have an structure similar to Spanish and can't be literally translated. I would like to learn how to think in English and try to be more direct when explaining my ideas. *Being more expressive in English*

I thougt that a good way to achieve that is forcing myself to stick to the language and invest time every day to learn new expressions. The purpose of this section is that, everyday I'll add something new I've learned from English, will explain it and also write some examples around that thing.

I saw this term in a Rose email explaining that when she was travelling in New Zealand using their own rented car they picked up two hitchhiker that had plans to also have some holidays in Thailand as we did.

**Swag**
We use swag to refer a bag where you carry for example your clothes for the gym. It can also be used for refering the bag is simultaneously the cushion to sleep on.

- When I was in the last Campus Party that took place in London I had to ask my aunt to borrow her swag because I hadn't use anyone before. She accepted lending it to me.
- After the campus party I stole some swags that we were giving when the event started and nobody was going to take them afterwards.
- I was going to buy a swag for the gym but I ended up using always the same bag that I use for going to work.

**Phrasal verb: Pull out**
Pull out means extracting something form its place, for example we can use pull-out to refer we're extracting a teeth. We can also pull of to mean that the train is leaving the station, the traing pulled out on time. And finally it can also be used to mean that we're stopping taking part in an activity.

*According to newspaper reports, Barack Obama has said that America will pull out of Afghanistan in 2011.*
