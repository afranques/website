Despite the fact that I have to use English every day in my company I feel that my pace learning English is very low. I'm not really investing time learning the language and my capacity retaining vocabulary is very low. I read expressions I memorize them but I'm very forgetful and I'll probably end up forgetting them and not using tme in contexts were would be great its use.

I also noticed that I tend to think in Spanish and translate to English which is not a good idea because it makes sentences construction complicated. Most of English expression don't have an structure similar to Spanish and can't be literally translated. I would like to learn how to think in English and try to be more direct when explaining my ideas. *Being more expressive in English*

I thougt that a good way to achieve that is forcing myself to stick to the language and invest time every day to learn new expressions. The purpose of this section is that, everyday I'll add something new I've learned from English, will explain it and also write some examples around that thing.

**Humble**
<br>
*Spanish translation 1: Humilde*
I read this word by the first time on [this article](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/the-secret-is-the-beginning-354091434f6d#.229zdtewp) by *Tobias van Scheider*. When we say that someone is humble we mean that the person is happy with enough things and it's always willing to help. Being humble means that you just need a few things have happiness, you're not an ambitious person. In the article it's used in the following sentence:

> This has always been a gentle reminder for myself when I was busy putting other people on pedestals. It’s a reminder that everyone is human, everyone has the same **humble beginnings**.

Tobias wants to say that when these people started their own projects and business they did it with a few resources, and with the time they were able to get more and get to the point where they're nowadays, *humble beginnings*.

**Wealth**
<br>
*Spanish translation 1: Riqueza*
If we think about health that refers to your body state, wealth refers to the economic situation instead. With wealth we refer all your material possessions and things that make you feel a rich people. These things can be money, a car, a house, ... When we want to say that a person has a good wealthy we can use the adjective *wealthy*.

**Phrasal verb: Stand out**
<br>
*Spanish translation 1: Resaltar*
This phrasal verb is synonymous of highlight. We could say that after the speech the president stood out all the huge effort its government team. We can also use stand out to refer that something is very much different from the rest like for example if we say that a student stands out it means that he/she is smarter than other students in the class, or if we say that a color stands out it means that compared with the rest it's more noticeable.

**Stealth**
<br>
*Spanish translation 1: Sigilo, Cautela*
<br>
*Spanish translation 2: Furtivo, Sigiloso*
<br>
We're use it as and noun for an action or a movement that is is executed cautiously. For example the silence and stealth of a hungry cat, or the stealth of a robber going into a house. We can also use it as an adjective to refer that the action was executed in an sneaky way and without detection. The *adverb* of stealth is *stealthily* and we can use it with verbs, like for example the robber broke into the house stealthily.
<br><br>
**Advocate**
<br>
*Spanish definition 1: Públicamente recomendar o apoyar*
<br>
*Spanish definition 2: Defensor*
<br>
We use advocate as a ver when we mean that we're supporting a particular cause or policy, for example we can be advocating the prohibition of bullfights, or we can also advocate the economic reform that the new polytic group is proposing. The person that advocates is called advocate, and we use generally with this structure *advocate of CAUSE*.
<br><br>
**Phrasal verb: Break down**
<br>
*Spanish translation 1: Averiarse, romperse*
<br>
*Spanish translation 2: Llorar, romper a llorar*
<br>
*Spanish translation 3: Colapsar, hundiers*
<br>
*Spanish translation 4: Tirar abajo, derribar*
<br>
*Spanish translation 5: Descomponer, desglosar*
<br>

The down preposition next to the verb break adds the sense of going down, if we thinkg for example if an electronic device that is working, break down means that the device is not working anymore, but if we think on a building, and the building breaks down, it means that the building was demolished. From the personal perspective, if someone breaks down it means that the person can't support the situation and he/she starts crying, we could say that the  person is somehow destroyed by what's happening.
Finally the term is also use to say that we're splitting something in small pieces like for example, we're breaking down an article in multiples subtopics.

**Hitchhiker**

A hitchhiker is a person that stay in a road waiting for someone driving to take him/her to someone. Generally these people don't have enough money to pay other transports like bus or train or they are adventurous people and prefer the experience to travel with someone and meet new people. Hitchhiker is a compound word of *hitch* and *hiker*:

- *Hitch*: It means stop someone using your finger.

diaper.

I saw this term in a Rose email explaining that when she was travelling in New Zealand using their own rented car they picked up two hitchhiker that had plans to also have some holidays in Thailand as we did.

**Swag**

We use swag to refer a bag where you carry for example your clothes for the gym. It can also be used for refering the bag is simultaneously the cushion to sleep on.

- When I was in the last Campus Party that took place in London I had to ask my aunt to borrow her swag because I hadn't use anyone before. She accepted lending it to me.
- After the campus party I stole some swags that we were giving when the event started and nobody was going to take them afterwards.
- I was going to buy a swag for the gym but I ended up using always the same bag that I use for going to work.

**Phrasal verb: Pull out**

Pull out means extracting something form its place, for example we can use pull-out to refer we're extracting a teeth. We can also pull of to mean that the train is leaving the station, the traing pulled out on time. And finally it can also be used to mean that we're stopping taking part in an activity or removing your soldiers from a given area.

*According to newspaper reports, Barack Obama has said that America will pull out of Afghanistan in 2011.*
