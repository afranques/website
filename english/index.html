Despite the fact that I have to use English every day in my company I feel that my pace learning English is very low. I'm not really investing time learning the language and my capacity retaining vocabulary is very low. I read expressions I memorize them but I'm very forgetful and I'll probably end up forgetting them and not using tme in contexts were would be great its use.

I also noticed that I tend to think in Spanish and translate to English which is not a good idea because it makes sentences construction complicated. Most of English expression don't have an structure similar to Spanish and can't be literally translated. I would like to learn how to think in English and try to be more direct when explaining my ideas. *Being more expressive in English*

I thougt that a good way to achieve that is forcing myself to stick to the language and invest time every day to learn new expressions. The purpose of this section is that, everyday I'll add something new I've learned from English, will explain it and also write some examples around that thing.

> Every day learn a new concept
