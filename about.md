I there üëã! I'm Pedro Pi√±era, a software engineer born and raised in Spain but that eventually ended up in Berlin, where I live nowadays with my girlfriend and no dogs (üòî). Every day of winter I wake up wondering what motivated me to move to Berlin, and honestly, I still don't know. I currently work for an amazing company, [Shopify üõí](https://shopify.com), which is revolutionizing the e-commerce like no one has done before. I devote most of my time at Shopify building tools for mobile developers. I used to be an iOS developer who fell in love and broke up with Xcode several times so I'm leveraging that knowledge to make mobile developers life easier with tools. I mostly write them with Rails and Ruby, technologies that scared me at first when I confronted their lack of types and magic for the first time, but that I ended up liking.

On the Internet, I try to be a genuine, honest and fun person. You'll find me saying and sharing what I think, even if that's against the established. I believe in the Internet where everyone share the real version of themselves and don't pretend to be another persona, or just accept what everyone around them does. This is unacceptable for some people, and even got me some enemies in the past, but that's fine.

I share my experiences through blog posts, [tweets](https://twitter.com/pepibumur), and most importantly, [open source projects](https://github.com/pepibumur). Whenever I come across a problem that I need to solve with software, I make it open source so that anyone facing a similar issue can save some time and help others. Moreover, open source has connected me with a lot of amazing people on the Internet. People that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet otherwise. Here are some open source projects that I'm the most proud of:

- [xcodeproj](https://github.com/tuist/xcodeproj): It's a Swift package to read, update and write Xcode projects.
- [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist): It's a command line tool that provides a standard interface to work with Xcode projects.
- [microfeatures-guidelines](https://github.com/tuist/microfeatures-guidelines): A proposal on how to structure frameworks in a modular iOS application.

I'm a very casual and approachable person, like you and most people in this world. Don't hesitate to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pepibumur) or send me an [email](mailto:pedro@ppinera.es) if you'd like to talk about anything or even grab a üç∫/‚òïÔ∏è.

## Event organization üéü

For two years, I used to organize a conference in Barcelona for app designers and developers [ADDC](https://addconf.com):

- [2017 edition](https://addconf.com/2017/)
- [2018 edition](https://addconf.com/2018/)

After having participated in the creation of a successful conference of great value for the attendees, I agreed with the other organizers to step down as organizer. Tha helped me focus on other priorities in my life.
