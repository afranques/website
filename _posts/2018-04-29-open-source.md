I've been wondering lately how many things that I do, I do them because everyone does them. With everyone sharing how they do things, and pitching us their library, their work-style, or even their tools I think software engineers are strongly biased by external opinions, including me. Are you using VIPER because it's a good fit for your project's need or because you saw a few companies using it? Are you using that library because it's saving you time or because you saw an example of how to use it and you thought you could just go with replicating the example?

Answering those questions has been eye-opening, and made me realize that some of my opinions and decissions were not made taken by me. If you have never done this exercise I encourage you to include an extra question when you have to make decissions:

> Am I doing this because everyone's doing it?

I don't like doing something when I don't feel passionate about it. It's easy to follow a trend and end up doing what everyone else is doing, but I prefer not to. Following trends, and already formed opinions do not help with forming yours, you just repeat what others are saying. Sometimes it might happen that the opinion that you form, is the same as others', and that's fine, but I think there's a huge value in spending some time to form it.

I asked myself the same question for open source. I realized that I prefer doing open source software over private's. Open source has become a huge thing in the softare industry, and companies that traditionally didn't do any open source started doing it. **Am I doing this because of the trend?** **Why am I doing it in the first place?**.

This question led me to an answer which I think describes well what open source means to me and why I devote part of my time to it, **interaction with people**. I like working with people more than computers. Unfortunately, that's something you don't have a lot if you work in tech, where your best friend is your computer. That changes if you do open source, because all of a sudden you are connected with people from all over the world working together towards the same goals.

For me, the beauty of open source is **creating community**. When I envision a new open source project, I like spending some time thinking about how I'd like the community to be and interact. One of the first things that I do is **creating an organization** which they can feel part of. I could create the repositories on my GitHub profile but it wouldn't be fair, in a sense that, they'd be contributing to a repository that belongs to me. I want them feel they are contributing to something that also belongs to them. I use the [Aeryn](https://github.com/moya/aeryn) tool from the Moya community to invite contributors after they merge their first PR. That makes them feel part of the family and encourages them to continue contributing to the project.

Interacting with people is harder than doing it with computers and software. Different profiles of developers will land on your project:

- A developer interested in contributing altruisticly to the project because they like the idea behind it.
- A developer that contributes towards their interests.
- A developer that extensively uses the project and reports a lot of bugs and great ideas.
- A developer that will make you feel like you are serving them and you should do whatever the asked you to do.

Working in open source has helped me improve my communication and interaction skills. Dealing with all different profiles and choosing the right language for every interaction is not easy. This is for me a challenge, but one of those challenges I enjoy going through.
