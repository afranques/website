As a developer who likes and believes in the benefits on making our software open, I devoted a vast amount of time building open source libraries and tools in the open. It helps me learn and grow as a software engineer and experiment with things I can't experiment with at work. In most cases, those contributions happen before/after work, when you need to care about other important things in life like family, friends, and health. Yes, those things are more important than work or open source, regardless of how much you like it.

One of the things that I find the most difficult of working on open source is doing it with mindfulness. I tend to get trapped by the joy and spend too much time thinking and working on it. As a result, I reach burnout points when I start wondering why I'm working on the project, what's the value of it, what if I spend my time on something else, what if no one uses it. I even lose the motivation for it.

Getting burnout of doing open source work is not something new. If you do a bit of research you can find a lot written about the topic:

In this blog post I'll walk you through some changes I've made to have a healthier relationship with the open source world.

### It's not my job
Open source is something that I do in my free time, something I'm not getting paid for, and which do for fun. While I have responsibilities and obligations at work 

### Have a vision and stick to it

### Say no when you have to
This is something I struggle a lot with because overall, I don't know how to say no. Luckilly, I'm getting better at this with some work. When 


<!-- It's very easy to get trapped by the joy of doing open source work and reach a burnout point when your passion turns into indiference

Although I'd read from different open source maintaners how easy is to get burned out being open source maintainer, I wasn't fully aware of how true that statement is until I took it more seriously. 

Most of this cotributions usually happens outside work,
