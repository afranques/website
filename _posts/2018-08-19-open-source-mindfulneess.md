As a developer who likes and believes in the benefits on making our software open, I devoted a vast amount of time building open source libraries and tools in the open. It helps me learn and grow as a software engineer and experiment with things I can't experiment with at work. In most cases, those contributions happen before/after work, when you need to care about other important things in life like family, friends, and health. Yes, those things are more important than work or open source, regardless of how much you like it.

One of the things that I find the most difficult of working on open source is doing it with mindfulness. I tend to get trapped by the joy and spend too much time thinking and working on it. As a result, I reach burnout points when I start wondering why I'm working on the project, what's the value of it, what if I spend my time on something else, what if no one uses it. I even lose the motivation for it.

Getting burnout of doing open source work is not something new. If you do a bit of research you can find a lot written about the topic:

In this blog post I'll walk you through some of the principles I'm sticking to in order to have a healthier open source contributions:

### It's not my job
Open source is something that I do in my free time, something I'm not getting paid for, and which do for fun. I don't take open source responsibilities that seriously and dedicate the amount of time I consider healthy and balanced with other responsibilities. If notice I'm assuming too many responsibilities and dedicating too much time is because I stop having fun and start worrying too much about the project. That does not mean that we don't have responsibilities, because open source projects come with them. As soon as developers and companies depend on it, they'll find bugs or constraints which they'll need to get fixed and improved. If you don't have some commitment to the project, no one will use it. It's up to you to ensure that the commitment is well 

### Have a vision
When I start an open source project I write down what I'm aiming for with it. Which issues I'm trying to solve, the maintenance the project is going to have, is it short or long term project? By doing so you avoid developers setting wrong expectations and you can use it to steer the project and guide discussions.  

### Stick to your vision
A vision is useless if we don't embrace it. We might hear lots of different opinions along the way. People that like your project and start supporting it since it's a baby, people that don't believe in the idea and think it's not worth spending time on something like that. If I dreamed with the project and envisioned it, I appreciate feedback but I'd like to prove myself wheter it was a wrong decision or something that brings value to developers.

### Priorities


### Say no when you have to
This is something I struggle a lot with because overall, I don't know how to say no. Luckilly, I'm getting better at this with some work. When

Although I'd read from different open source maintaners how easy is to get burned out being open source maintainer, I wasn't fully aware of how true that statement is until I took it more seriously.
