I like understand why I do certain things in my life. I believe each action we take in our lives has a purpose. To give you some examples, when I workout, I do it because I want to feel healthier and sportier. If I sleep a siesta, is because my body and brain feels exhausted and needs some recovery time. When we post on the internet, it might be because we'd like people to know more about our thoughts. That's for instance the reason why I'm writing the lines that you are currently reading.

The purpose is in most cases obvious, but there are usually some other actions where the purpose is hard to find.
