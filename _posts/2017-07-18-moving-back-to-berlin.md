On January 2017 I moved to Budapest. My girlfriend was living there and the distance was very hard. I had been in Berlin for approximately 2 years, and although I loved the city, I thought moving to Budapest was the right call to make. I liked and like my company, SoundCloud, so I wanted to continue working for it. I appreciate a lot the opportunity that I was given by them, working remotely supporting the team and the project from there. I was very excited; new working setup, new city and life style.

The first thing that I noticed during that period is that I'm not a remote person *(thanks Maria for helping me to notice it)*. I had read a lot about remote working and how cool it is, and I started the remote setup full of appealing expectations. Unfortunately, none of them were as expected, and I went through a very tough period. I missed hanging out with my colleagues, grabbing a coffe or a beer afterwork, brainstorming using the whiteboards at the office. I felt that I missed what I liked the most of working from an office, the people. I tried to prove myself that what wasn't working wasn't me, but the setup. That working from a coworking space would help with my bad feelings, but it turned out that it didn't. At the same time I was sort of hiding all those feelings because I didn't want Maria to see that moving to Budapest was affecting me so badly workwise. But she is smart, and she noticed it from the the first day. I still remember her describing me as a *"non-remote person"*. She knows me very well!

Budapest is a very lovely city, full of stunning views to enjoy, and thermal baths to relax after a very intense day. However, I found very difficult to have friends in the city. Compared to Berlin, where you find a lot of people relocating to the city and having the need to meet new people, Budapest was very hard in that sense. It makes total sense. The majority of the population, is local and they have their friends circles. The same thing would happen if you moved to Spain, people would have their friends and use Spanish all the time. This difficulty making friends, together with the work situation, wasn't a good experience for me. My team at SoundCloud and Maria were very supportive all the time. They both were aware of my feelings and tried to help me as much as they could.

I kept running, even though temperatures didn't help with it. It helped me disconnect and think about myself. I didn't run as much as I would have liked, but I'll try to get better. I didn't take care of my diet as much as I used to do, and as a result I got some extra weight. You notice those extra Kilograms when you are in your hometown and your elderly neighbours tell you how splendid you are. Yeah! Splendidly fat.
