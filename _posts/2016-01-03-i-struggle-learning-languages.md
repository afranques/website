Languages are not my speciality. I’ve tried my best but still struggle a lot when I have to use a language other than mine. Apart from Spanish (my mother tongue), I know English which use daily at work, in online interaction, and everything I share. After all the years studying English at the school, when I had to really use the language I felt like if all the grammar I had learnt wasn’t useful, because I didn’t know how to use the language itself. I knew how to use the past tense, the future, modals, conditionals, report speech, the verb to be *(which luckily was the first theory point every year…)*.

As soon as you travel abroad you figure out how important is learning languages and communication in general. You meet new people, you can share your thoughts and also give your opinion. Someone from Thailandia and you can understand each other because you have something in common, the language. I’m currently living in Berlin, and as you might guess, not everyone knows English. You have to face awkward situations where you don’t understand each other. That made me seriously rethink the importance of learning German or any other language.

Every day I use the English I struggle at it. When I have to talk to my workmates at [SoundCloud][1], when I tweet something, when I want to expose something I learnt or that I designed. The level of insecurity has been sometimes so hight that I have avoided conversations in the past or trying to be speaker in conferences because the language had to be English.

My first feeling when I speak English is, *what if I commit a mistake?* I struggle to build the sentences properly, to use a rich vocabulary and common English expressions but I end up committing more mistakes and not pronouncing properly because after the first mistake my insecurity increases. Despite I try not to think about that I always fall into the same problem.

I read books in English, listen to Audiobooks, watch movies in English, even write books and articles in English. However nothing seems to improve despite all these resources. It’s like if I haven’t found the formula to acquire that ability, or maybe I don’t practise on the right way.

I think that everything with practise can be achieved, it might be harder in my case because my brain is not willing to
