In the past are those days when you automated your tasks using Make, Rake or Fastlane. These tools provided an interface an tools to automate certain tasks in our projects. Each of them had their own strenghts and weaknesses. If we take Make for example, it requires some bash knowledge, but on the other side it is more robust than the other solution *(it does't depend on anything that is not in your system)*. Rake or Fastlane made the definition of our tasks easier using a more readable language like Ruby, but they required to install some dependencies. Fastlane for example comes with some dependencies that need to be installed in the system using Ruby gems.

While those tools made our lives easier as developers, I felt we could leverage Swift and its types system to automate tasks, using Xcode and its editor to build and test our tasks easily. I started to work on the Swift version of Make that I'm pleased to introduce in this post, [Sake](https://github.com/xcodeswift/sake). It's in a very early stage but ready to be used. I'm eager to get feedback from you and improve the tool with your help. Please don't hesitate to contribute with the repo or propose ideas!

## Why Sake?
I'm Swift/Objective-C developer and I'm very used to work with compilers that catch any issues with the types in our code. Types are a very powerful tool and used properly can make our apps safer bringing a lot of confidence to the developer. In most of the projects that I've been involved, either open or closed source, the automation was mainly done using bash or Ruby and tools like Rake or Fastlane. Many times I've been myself trying to debug failing lanes or tasks using `pry` in Ruby or printing stuff in the console to analyze the execution of the task. Sometimes these issues happened on CI and I spent a lot of time debugging them until I could figure out where the issue was coming from. Does it sound familiar to you?

## How it works

## Limitation
- Swift ABI


### What's next?
- Facilitate testing.
- Support .swift files from Sake folder.
- Officially include the formula in the Homebrew tap.
- Improve utils.
- Version `SakefileDescription`.
