On my quest to abandon social networks, this week has been the turn for Twitter. While I've met a lot of people and stayed up to date with the news in the industry, I don't find the time that I spend with it healthy. These are the reason that motivated me to make the decision:

- **Feel like a product:** My timeline is full of tailored ads. I don't want to be the product of any company and I don't believe on the Internet being used like that. Sadly, this has become a pattern for many companies.
- **Losing taste:** Seeing that everyone is doing things, makes me feel that I have to do things as well to be part of the revolution: *things for the community, open source projects, blog posts...* I often wondered if I did things because I believed in them or because I followed what everyone's else was doing. Those reflections led me to things like:
  - Not attending conferences for the shake of attending.
  - Not bootstrapping open source projects every week to show that I'm an active person on the industry.
  - Not doing things for the community but to solve problems.
  - Looking up books myself instead of following recommendations on Twitter.
- **Showing off:** I like talking about my work but I don't like doing work to talk about it. I felt I had to do the latter to show off as much as everyone's: *blog posts, open source projects, newsletter, tweets...* 

When I managed to ignore Twitter, I realized I was a genuine version of myself. I listened to myself and made my own decisions. If I felt like coding, or writing a blog post I did. If there was something new everyone was talking about, I learned to be comfortable with not reading about it. 

For all these reasons, I'm abandoning Twitter. I'll be writing blog posts on this, my personal blog, and working on open source projects, mostly [Tuist](https://tuist.io).


Twitter has been great, but it's time to listen for myself.
