Someone's life can be seen as a succession of mistakes and learnings. Every day is an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Unfortunately, I've never kept track of those learnings, mistakes and reflections that I've gone through. That's something I've done at work, like running retrospective meetings, and I think it'd apply as well to our lives. I've created this page to track down those things, and share them with anyone that might be running through similar conflicts/reflections or would like to help me by exposing other points of view.

## Why üìù
* I can see what worried and concerned me in the past.
* I can enrich my perceptions with other people's point of view.
* I do the exercise of writing it down, which helps me consolidate or even reconsider my opinions.
* I believe in sharing, both positive and negative things, and I'd like to help people feel more comfortable with sharing negative things on the Internet as well.
* I structure my thoughts and the connections between them when I write them down.
* We live in a fast-pace world, where we barely pause to reflect. This repository is a motivation for me to do so.

I'm not afraid of sharing this publicly, even if they show my flaws as a human being. Nowadays, it seems that we only say the best of us on the Internet, we create a persona of what the people expects from us. That's not real, that harms you and everyone around you. Let's share the reality and help each other become better people.

## Reflections üß†
In this section, I include a list of reflections that I've gone through sorted chronologically:

## Focus üëì
In the past, I used to be a multi-tasking person. I sometimes struggle with it nowadays, but I think I got much better at it. I used to be involved in many projects, activities and side projects. I did a lot, but nothing at the same time. I keep this section up to date with what's my current focus.

**I'm currently focused on building a macOS app to help mobile teams with giving/receiving feedback when developing features for their apps**

## Books üìô
Although there are good platforms out there to keep track of the books that I'm reading and read, I'd rather keep track of them here, where I can not only list them but add a personal review of what the book meant to me.
